# Visualize Covariance and Correlation Coefficient

## I. Introduction

This website is created to illustrate and explain one of the fundamental concepts in statistics: **the relationship between covariance and correlation coefficient**. 

This project provides a visual and interactive experience to understand:

- The difference between **covariance** and **correlation coefficient**
- How **scaling (multiplication)** affects these statistical measures
- How **translation (addition)** impacts covariance and correlation
- The concept of **scale-invariant** vs **scale-dependent** measures
- Interactive exploration of real-time statistical calculations

## II. Statistical Background

### Basic Concepts

In statistics, understanding the relationship between two variables is crucial:
- **Covariance**: Measures the joint variability of two random variables
- **Correlation Coefficient**: A normalized measure of linear relationship between variables

### Key Differences

**Covariance Formula**:
```
Cov(X,Y) = (1/(n-1)) × Σ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)
```

**Correlation Coefficient Formula**:
```
r = Cov(X,Y) / (σx × σy)
```

### Problem with Covariance

Covariance has a major limitation:
- **Scale-dependent**: Changes dramatically with units of measurement
- **Difficult interpretation**: No standardized range of values
- **Unit-sensitive**: Different units produce vastly different covariance values

### Solution: Correlation Coefficient

The correlation coefficient addresses these issues:
- **Scale-invariant**: Unaffected by linear transformations (scaling)
- **Standardized range**: Always between -1 and +1
- **Easy interpretation**: Clear meaning of strength and direction

## III. Mathematical Principles

### Effects of Linear Transformations

#### Scaling (Multiplication)
When data is transformed by: `X' = aX` and `Y' = bY`
- **Covariance**: `Cov(X',Y') = ab × Cov(X,Y)`
- **Correlation**: `r(X',Y') = r(X,Y)` (unchanged)

#### Translation (Addition)
When data is transformed by: `X' = X + c` and `Y' = Y + d`
- **Covariance**: `Cov(X',Y') = Cov(X,Y)` (unchanged)
- **Correlation**: `r(X',Y') = r(X,Y)` (unchanged)

### Why Correlation is Superior

1. **Unit Independence**: Correlation is dimensionless
2. **Bounded Range**: Values between -1 and +1 are easily interpretable
3. **Standardized Interpretation**:
   - r = +1: Perfect positive linear relationship
   - r = -1: Perfect negative linear relationship
   - r = 0: No linear relationship
